## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Vinny Huynh, and I'm a software engineering student at SJSU. My main interests are in working on and developing backend systems with Java and Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NoteNest, a collaborative AI-powered note-sharing platform built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m experimenting with AI for smart systems and exploring ways to optimize database performance.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source backend projects or educational software and tools.
